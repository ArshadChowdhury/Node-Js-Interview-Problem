# Node Js Interview Task from Health Bondhu
## I was asked to develop a minimalistic e-commerce website with insert products & place order system
## I used express.js to create the api, I also left the request.rest so it'd be easier to test it out
## Feel free to change the information given in there to check authentication & other api calls
